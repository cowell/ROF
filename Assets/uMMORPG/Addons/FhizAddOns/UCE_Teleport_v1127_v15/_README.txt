DESCRIPTION
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

A greatly enhanced version of the built in teleporter with a whole lot of customization options.
It uses a Collider to represent the teleporter, so you can place it everywhere in your scene.
The teleporter is triggered when entered by a player and requires the player to confirm the
teleport via a button click on a GUI window.

This teleporter system does not require a NPC and therefore has no overhead and a very small
footprint.

* Add a usage cost like gold, coins or items.
* Limit usage to a certain class.
* Limit usage to a level range (eg. 5-10).
* Usage requires a quest to be completed first.

You can easily mix and match all teleporter requirements and build teleporters that are
easier or more expensive to use. Limit where your players can go and build class specific
teleporters, quest related zones or level specific zones for your players!

Please note that this teleporter works only on targets within the same scene.

Edit the constants in the top of the UCE_UI_Teleport file in order to change the
notification texts send to player when accessing a teleporter.
